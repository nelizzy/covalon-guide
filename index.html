<span class="inline-block titleSeparator"  ></span><div class="block wide"  ><p>Welcome to Covalon, a Pathfinder 2nd Edition living world campaign! Our campaign offers players a way to experience the Pathfinder 2e roleplaying game at their own pace. Whether you want to dive into dangerous dungeons every other day or just do a bit of text roleplaying a couple of times a month, Covalon has something for everyone.</p>
</div><div class="block wide"  ><h2 id="what-is-covalon">What is Covalon?</h2>
</div><div class="block wide"  ><p>Covalon is a “living world” style tabletop RPG campaign, using the Pathfinder 2e system, with a focus on providing drop-in/drop-out style adventures and role play in a post-apocalyptic fantasy setting. Our unique campaign weaves a cohesive and open narrative from the backstory and role play contributions of the players with a focus on slow and relaxed progression, giving everyone a chance to enjoy the campaign and develop their chaorracter at their own pace. Individual adventures are jam-packed with combat and intrigue without affecting an overarching plot, which allows characters to have engaging experiences without needing to worry atrbout missing out on a grander narrative. Whether you choose to play with us daily or once a week, Covalon offers fulfilling gameplay for everyone! To make this cohesive setting work, we have some special rules that you may find different from normal campaigns. In general, we try to stick to rules-as-written (RAW) as much as possible, in order to ensure that scheduled play sessions (universally referred to as “adventures” in Covalon) are run as fairly and consistently as possible between our many Game Masters (universally referred to as “dungeon guides” in Covalon). While we encourage players to invent civilizations and deities to fill out our setting, we place strict limits on homebrewed mechanical features, such as items and class features, and we do not use certain optional rules such as voluntary flaws, free archetypes, and dual classing. There are, of course, some exceptions to these rules, which can be found in this ever-updating document. <a href="https://discord.gg/covalon">Click here to join Covalon!</a></p>

<div class='blank'>  </div><p>All players are expected to follow the expectations and guidelines outlined on this page. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary consequences, such as being temporarily muted, prohibited from joining adventures, or being banned from the campaign.</p>
<h2 id="community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</h2>
<p>The purpose of this community is to have a place where everyone is welcome, and can have fun playing Pathfinder together. With this in mind, we have these guidelines to make sure everyone enjoys their experience in Covalon.</p>
<h3 id="1-player-age">1. Player Age</h3>
<p>All players must be 18 years of age or older. In addition to this, all characters must be of adult age for their species in order to prevent uncomfortable role playing situations.</p>
<h3 id="2-be-civil">2. Be Civil</h3>
<p>This is a diverse community of many countries, cultures, religions, sexual orientations, gender identities, and beliefs. Disrespectful talk of any kind will not be tolerated.</p>
<h3 id="3-prohibited-themes">3. Prohibited Themes</h3>
<p>Although the minimum age requirement to join the server is 18, all out of character conversations and role playing themes must be kept appropriate for a PG-13 rating. Additionally, the following topics and themes are not permitted to be discussed or role played on the server</p>
<ul>
<li>Slavery</li>
<li>Racism</li>
<li>Sexual Abuse</li>
<li>Real-World Politics</li>
<li>Obscene Content:</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, please limit discussion of your personal difficulties within Covalon. We are a supportive community, but the primary goal of the server is to roll dice and have fun.</p>
<h3 id="4-respect-other-users">4. Respect Other Users</h3>
<p>Do not threaten or harass other users. This includes “doxxing,” or revealing any private information about a player without their consent. It also includes pressuring another player to sell, give away, or donate items they receive from an adventure. Do not engage in unsolicited or unwanted sexual advances or conversations of a personal sexual nature. These types of conversations should be limited to Discord direct messaging, and only after receiving the explicit consent of all involved users.</p>

<h3 id="6-self-promotion">6. Self-Promotion</h3>

<p>All suggestions for the server or sensitive concerns should be brought to the private attention of the Administrator and Moderator teams via the ticket system, which can be accessed via the #create-a-ticket channel in the Discord server.</p>
