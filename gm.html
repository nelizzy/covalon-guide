<div class="block "><p><em>Welcome to the GM’s guide for running adventures in the Covalon Living World server. This guide offers new and existing GM’s a single location for all of the rules, guidelines and tools available for running high quality, fun adventures in Covalon!</em></p>
</div><span class="inline-block separator"  ></span></div><h2 id="running-games-in-covalon">Running Games in Covalon</h2>
<p>Covalon is a living world server, and as a result there are many differences in comparison to a traditional home game among friends. As a core tenet, we try to keep the experience of games between adventures consistent and we try to make the experience of running games as enjoyable as possible. At its most basic, this means four things:</p>
<h3 id="host-when-you-want-to">Host when you want to</h3>
<p>As a Dungeon Guide, you choose when you run your adventures. There is no quota of games you are expected to host, and you can run any type of game you wish to run. You may run as often or as infrequently as your time and motivation allows.</p>
<h3 id="consistency-of-games">Consistency of Games</h3>
<p>Our game types, explained in greater detail below, have guidelines on how to build encounters, settings and treasure piles to ensure that the experience across the server is consistent. In this way, players have a good understanding of what to expect when they sign up to play a game.</p>
<h3 id="give-it-to-me-raw">Give It To Me RAW!</h3>
<p>We use Rules As Written (RAW) rulings as much as possible to reduce the burden on Dungeon Guides of needing to learn a multitude of server-specific rules in order to run games. You should be able to run an adventure and reference core rules of the game in order to make mid-session judgements if needed without having to reference a thousand other documents.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>There are however occasions in which we have made non-RAW rulings in order to better fit a Living World Campaign. These can be found in the #!?Rule-Clarifications-and-faqs channel.</p>
<div class='blank'> </div><div class='blank'></div><div class='blank'></div><div class='blank'></div><div class='blank'> </div><h3 id="choose-your-table">Choose your table</h3>
<p>As a Covalon Dungeon Guide you have full autonomy to choose who sits at your table. You will never be mandated to run for specific people or groups, and we will never implement server systems that impact who you take at your table.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><div class="block note"  ><h5 class=" "  style="text-align:center;" id="gm-roles">GM Roles</h5>
<p>There are 3 key roles for Dungeon Guides in Covalon.</p>
<h5 id="aspiring-dungeon-guides">Aspiring Dungeon Guides</h5>
<p>Individuals that have expressed an interest in running games in Covalon and have yet to complete their shadowed adventure(s).</p>
<h5 id="dungeon-guides">Dungeon Guides</h5>
<p>Individuals that have completed their shadowing and have a good understanding of Covalon’s systems.</p>
<h5 id="senior-dungeon-guides">Senior Dungeon Guides</h5>
<p>Highly trusted, experienced Dungeon Guides who have demonstrated a clear understanding of Covalon’s ethos and no longer need to submit their adventures for approval before running a game!</p>

<span class="inline-block separator"  ></span></div><p>Thank you for taking the first step to running games for us! As an Aspiring Dungeon Guide you are in the process of learning how games are set up on the server.</p>
<p>Aspiring Dungeon Guides should read through this guide in its entirety before submitting their first game for approval.</p>
<p>Once you have completed your adventure outline, Create A Ticket to submit it for approval. Your first adventure approval ticket must include:</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><h3 id="your-adventure-outline">Your Adventure Outline</h3>
<p>This can be as simple as a block of text, or utilising one of the tools created by the community for adventure submissions. As a minimum, this must include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hook that players will see in your #Scheduled-Events Post. This should be the call to adventure provided by your portal specialist.</li>
<li>All of the monsters and hazards that the players will face, including links to Archives of Nethys entries</li>
<li>All of the treasure the players will receive</li>
<li>A breakdown of the narrative of the dungeon</li>
<li>Any other specific details that the staff team should know about, including potential trigger warnings or themes.</li>
</ul>
<div class="block note"  ><p>Covalon has a spreadsheet that lays out everything you need for submission. You can use this by visiting this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I_sD6f8Qe66KtikEvpC7x3fxVVeBptZWDsxcmHbDROI/edit#gid=0">link</a> and creating a copy for your own use! We encourage all Covalon GMs to use this tool!</p>
</div><h3 id="your-portal-specialist-npc">Your Portal Specialist NPC</h3>
<p>Every Dungeon Guide creates their own Portal Specialist NPC. This is an individual who works for the Dungeoneering Society and provides quests and guidance to the party. They are also responsible for opening and sustaining the portal to take adventurers to the quest location. Your Portal Specialist must be cooperative with the party, and invested in their success. You should submit a brief summary of their personality and a description of their appearance for approval.</p>
<p>Your player character cannot be a portal specialist.</p>
<h3 id="scheduling-a-shadow">Scheduling A Shadow</h3>
<p>In your ticket, submit two proposed times on non-consecutive days that you are able to run the adventure along with the time you intend to run. As an Aspiring Dungeon Guide you must be shadowed by a Moderator when you run games, and providing two days and times increases the likelihood someone will be available to shadow you.</p>
<p>Once you are approved and have a moderator ready, you’re good to run your adventure! The shadowing moderator will keep your ticket open to provide you feedback after your adventure.</p>

			<div class="columnWrapper"><div class="block wide"  ><h1 id="chapter-2-designing-games">Chapter 2: Designing Games</h1>
<span class="inline-block separator"  ></span></div><h3 id="core-rules">Core Rules</h3>
<p>Before starting to design games for Covalon, it is strongly recommended that you read through <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=311">chapter 9</a> and <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=480">chapter 10</a> of the Core Rulebook. This includes the core rules of the system in terms of creating encounters that are balanced, challenging and fun!</p>
<h3 id="apl-and-party-size">APL and Party Size</h3>
<p>When designing a game adventure, you should start with determining your Average Party Level (APL). You can do this by working out the average of your party members if you know them in advance, or selecting an APL in advance you expect to have.</p>
<p>Most adventures in Covalon assume <strong>6 players</strong> in attendance. You can run an adventure with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 6 players.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your party size will impact your <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=498">experience Budget</a>. Sometimes you will find that the average party level of a group is in the middle of two whole levels. In the event of finding you have a party of a 0.5 interval, you should balance for one additional player of the lower level. For example, if you have a party of six with an APL of 6.5, you should balance for 7 level 6 characters.</p>
<h3 id="building-encounters">Building Encounters</h3>
<div class="block descriptive right"  style="width:135px;"><h4 class=" "  style="text-align:center;" id="level-1-characters">Level 1 Characters</h4>
<p>Level 1 characters are especially fragile. When a first level character is present, no creatures above level 3 can be used.</p>
</div><p>It’s time to select your creatures! For most Covalon game modes, you need to design for Moderate difficulty encounters. <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=497">This page</a> is the perfect place to check the experience values of monsters you are selecting for your challenges. Keep in mind you cannot select a monster that is more than 3 levels above the lowest level player in the party. Keep this in mind when designing encounters, especially if you don’t know who your players are yet.</p>
<p>Of course, monsters aren’t the only challenges your players will face. You can find the experience costs of <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=679">hazards here</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes you may wish to use particular environments, weather, magical terrain or other non-creature, non-hazard considerations within your adventure. This should be included within your approval, and often will require an experience value associated with it. The experience value should be proportionate to how heavily it will affect the party. A large patch of difficult terrain might only be 10 experience, but a patch of Energy Surge Terrain with on-type monsters might be worth 20 or more experience.</p>
<p>Always make sure to double check the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15CFU66rjnT7x-91z630Dg9P4_hTRFr25dCOWVqGvx6Q/edit?usp=sharing">Restricted Monsters</a> list for any experience adjustments that need to be made for certain monsters in Covalon adventures!</p>
<div class="block note"  ><h5 class=" "  style="text-align:center;" id="custom-creatures">Custom Creatures</h5>
<p>Sometimes, you may not be able to find a creature that fits the thematic of the adventure you’re running, or the creatures that do fit are the wrong level for your intended APL.</p>
<p>In these cases you can use the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995">Building Creatures</a> rules in order to create or scale a custom creature. There are similar rules for <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1043">Building Hazards</a>. Wheng so, please submit the full statblock as part of your approval.</p>
</div><h3 id="covalon-considerations">Covalon Considerations</h3>
<p>Unless specified otherwise in the game type instructions, all adventures in Covalon must follow the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each player gets one Hero Point at the start of the adventure, up to the usual maximum of 3 if they already have any. Unlike other Hero Points, if this Hero Point is not used by the end of the adventure it is lost.</li>
<li>The party must be able to try to escape if they choose to. The portal cannot close behind them, and they cannot be locked into an area.</li>
<li>The adventure must stick to the timeframe for the game type. If it appears to be going over time, wrap the adventure up early.</li>
<li>As long as players overcome at least one challenge or encounter, they receive full experience if they leave early. They receive all of the loot that they have found so far.

			<div class="columnWrapper"><h3 id="alternate-encounters">Alternate Encounters</h3>
<p>Alternate encounters are any kind of encounter that counts towards the adventure’s XP budget but is not a standard combat. Some examples of this are chases, skill challenges, or social encounters. The following are just some examples of the many subsystems detailed in chapter 4 of the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1187">Gamemastery Guide</a>. As long as encounters are balanced, fun, and fit within Covalon’s general adventure rules, we’re willing to review them for use in your Covalon adventures! Many Expedition missions include examples of using subsystems.</p>
<h4 id="chases">Chases</h4>
<p>For chases, please include all obstacles, their relevant skills and DC of those checks, and the failure condition. There are many ways to run a chase! Some of the most common are having every PC take damage equal to Table 2-16 Complex Damage in the hazard building rules at the end of a round, or something happens at the end of each round based on how many total successes and failures the party obtained. More guidance on chases can be found on <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1210">this</a> Archives of Nethys page.</p>
<h4 id="influencesocial-encounters">Influence/Social Encounters</h4>
<p>The Influence subsystem is one way to run a structured social encounter. If you wish to submit an influence encounter, please provide the influence stat blocks of your NPCs.  Note that if a social encounter doesn’t really have a clear goal or consequences, it might be better off as just an NPC the party can interact with, and not a social encounter that is worth XP. More guidance on the Influence subsystem can be found on <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1201">this</a> Archives of Nethys page.</p>
<h4 id="skill-challengesvictory-points">Skill Challenges/Victory Points</h4>
<p>Skill challenges and social encounters can also be less defined, or take place over a longer time than a typical initiative round. For example, maybe the party needs to succeed at certain checks X number of times before they fail such checks Y number of times, or overcome different obstacles as they travel to a dangerous location. In order to approve these, we will need a description of the challenge, relevant skills, DCs of all checks, and the consequences or benefits of failure and success.</p>

</div><p>Selecting loot for your adventure is a critical part of its design! Below, you will find the rules and guidelines for selecting loot and treasure for your Covalon adventures.

<h4 id="gold-and-treasure">Gold and Treasure</h4>
<p>Cash is great! At least 50% of the treasure budget must be gold to ensure people can buy or commission items they want instead of relying on drops. You may flavor a “gold” reward as various valuables that the Dungeoneering Society will pay the adventurers for, if you like.</p>
<h4 id="appropriately-levelled-consumable-items">Appropriately Levelled Consumable Items</h4>
<p>Bombs, mutagens, elixirs, potions, scrolls, talismans are great rewards that players will often not craft for themselves. Consumable items given as loot should be the same level or lower than the APL of the party.</p>
<h4 id="appropriately-levelled-thematic-permanent-items">Appropriately Levelled, Thematic Permanent Items</h4>
<p>Permenant items of a maximum level of the party’s APL make for good loot. Particularly in lower tiers, it is encouraged to drop fundamental weapon and armor runes. Staves, wands, spellhearts, and accesory items such as gloves or belts all fill out an adventurer’s kit. Try to pick loot that is somewhat thematic to your game’s setting!</p>
<h4 id="appropriately-levelled-formulas">Appropriately Levelled Formulas</h4>
<p>Formulas are the only way for Covalonians to gain access to uncommon and rare items! Formulas given as loot should be the same level or lower than the APL of the party.</p>
<div class="block note"  ><p>Up to 2 formulas can be included as loot for an appropriately themed dungeon. When distributing loot at the end of a adventure, a formula is not considered a permanent item and can be directly donated to Covalon!</p>

<h4 id="uncommon-rare-or-unique-items">Uncommon, Rare, or Unique Items</h4>
<p>Items of Uncommon, Rare, or Unique rarity require staff permission before being dropped as loot. If you want to know if an item is approved to drop, check the crafting spreadsheet pinned in the #crafting-hall channel to see if we have the formula already, or do a search in #loot-chat to see if it’s been dropped before. If it has, that item is OK to drop as loot.</p>
<h4 id="formulas-of-higher-level-than-the-adventure">Formulas of Higher Level than the Adventure</h4>

<div class="block descriptive right"  style="width:220px;"><h4 id="singular-sessions">Singular Sessions</h4>
<p>Excluding Excursions, all adventures must be entirely self-contained. You may not run a dungeon or patrol that is a sequel, prequel or otherwise narratively linked to another adventure.</p>
</div><p>Dungeons are a game type initiated as a mission from the Dungeoneering Society. Your Portal Specialist transports the party to faraway lands via portal magic to investigate mysteries, gather supplies and defeat dangers.</p>
<p>A dungeon generally consists of three moderate encounters that are appropriate for the Average Party Level. These adventures generally take about 3 hours and must not go longer than 4 hours. Activities besides combat may be budgeted as an encounter, such as a trap, a puzzle, a social encounter, or exploration/travel, with approval in your approval ticket.</p>
</div><h3 id="patrols">Patrols</h3>
<p>Covalon Patrols are small adventures and missions that take place in the immediate vicinity of Covalon-controlled locations. A patrol consists of a single moderate combat encounter, and is expected to last no more than an hour. Patrols should have little to no narrative elements or non-combat encounters. Patrols never contain permanent magic items as loot, but magical consumables (such as talismans, potions, scrolls, etc) are allowed.</p>
<div class='columnSplit'>  </div><div class="block note"  ><h5 id="a-note-on-experience">A Note on Experience</h5>
<p>Remember that the experience budget for a dungeon is 250 <strong>pre-adjusted</strong> experience. This means that for a party of 4 you have 250 experience to spend on challenges. For a party of 6, you have around 375 experience to spend and a moderate encounter has a budget of 120 experience!</p>
<p>You can double check the experience for different party sizes <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=498">here.</a></p>

<p>Patrols for level 4-6 take place around the Maw near Covalon. Monsters for Tier 2 patrols should be themed or described as corrupted or influenced by the Maw in some way. This does not change their statblocks and is for narrative reasons only.</p>
<div class='columnSplit'>  </div><h5 id="tier-3">TIER 3</h5>

<p>Expedition missions are a special game-mode that is heavily intertwined with the ongoing meta-narrative of Covalon, beyond gathering supplies and going through portals. Expeditions represent our efforts to reclaim the world after the Cataclysm and face the challenges left behind in a shattered realm. Expeditions require the installation of the Covalon Expedition Module on Foundry. Expeditions consist of a choice of three missions that have special instructions that can be found inside the Module.</p>
<div class="block note"  ><h5 id="expedition-finales">Expedition Finales</h5>
<p>Expedition Finales are a single boss encounter with special mechanics that are narratively tied to defending the planted Seeds of Terra used to purify reclaimed areas of the world map from Maw monsters. Check out the Expedition Module for more details on how to run each finale!</p>
</div><h3 id="excursions-and-sagas">Excursions and Sagas</h3>
<p>In Excursions, players explore areas surrounding liberated Expedition locations in an in-world effort to maintain security of settlements and build goodwill with nearby survivors. In contrast to dungeons, these adventures feature some narrative continuity, longer adventuring days, and a larger experience budget.”Excursion” refers to one mission in a set of up to three narratively linked sessions. This set of sessions is called a “Saga” or “Excursion Saga.”</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>Each Excursion in a Saga should last between 3 and 4 hours, but not more than 4, and each Saga must include between 1 and 3 Excursions lasting up to 1 day in-world. Excursions have no effect on Downtime activities, and GMs are not required to run Excursions in a given Saga for the same group or tier.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>Each Excursion within a Saga can include recurring NPCs, locations, and themes.
Encounters in excursions follow the normal rules for Dungeons. Each excursion has an additional 40 XP (30 or 20 for parties of smaller size) added to the total session budget. This XP can be used to include additional creatures or hazards at any point in the excursion, including to create encounters more difficult than a 120 XP Moderate Encounter (100, or 80 for parties of smaller size).</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>Excursion submissions must include a narrative. These storylines cannot affect Covalon as a whole (e.g. new deities, attacks or plots against on Covalon itself) and must focus on the Excursion’s region. Dungeon Summary posts for Excursions should be no more than 200 words long.</p>
<h3 id="descents">Descents</h3>
<p>A Descent may currently only be run by Senior DGs and Administrators. These adventures are exclusively for the current highest and second highest tier of play, and always balanced for the maximum level players in these tiers can achieve.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>Descents are composed of up to four single-room encounters. After clearing a room, players may make the decision to continue onward to the next room or retreat with any rewards they have collected so far.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>After clearing a room, each player may undertake one 10-minute activity.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>Descents have a maximum time limit of 4 hours. If the third encounter is completed with less than 45 minutes remaining the party may not continue. The race against the clock is part of the challenge!</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>Descents are composed of combat encounters exclusively. No narrative, puzzles, exploration, or roleplay will be present.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>Clearing at least one room rewards the party with 250 experience in total and 1376 gp per room per player. These gp rewards should be flavored as “Maw Stones” that Arto uses Covalon Funds to purchase from the players.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>The first encounter in a Descent is moderate difficulty. Each subsequent encounter must be severe difficulty. The restricted monster list does not apply to Descents, and you may use more sinister environments when designing Descent rooms.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>Descents are usually run for 6 players, but can be run for a party of smaller than 6. Encounters should still be balanced as Moderate for the first encounter, and then Severe for each subsequent room. The time limit is reduced by 15 minutes per player less than 6.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>For the purposes of prebuffing, only 1 hour or longer duration effects can be applied before entering the Maw. After an encounter, each player gets exactly ten minutes to take an activity or use other actions. As the group travels to the next room, ten minutes of “travel time” occurs, flavored as timey wimey Maw magic.</p>

<p>Specific PVP events where two teams of three players face off against each other are brawls. Brawls may only be hosted by Senior Dungeon Guides.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>Brawls are always run on the arena map, which is available in the Covalon Foundry Module. (Use a grid size of 128 pixels.) One team starts in the red square in the top right and the other team starts in the blue square in the top left. All platforms are 10 feet high. The DC to climb any ladder or rigging is 10, but magical oil is applied to the sides of all platforms to make climbing more difficult; use a level-based DC based on the average player level for climbing the sides of platforms. For control points, the three yellow squares indicate the control points, while the blue flag in the top-left and the red flag in the bottom-right indicate the locations of the blue and red flags respectively, as well as the scoring locations for the blue and red teams, respectively.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>All participants in Brawl gain Gold and experience, even if they lose. The winning team each receives a Gladiator Token for prestige. For more information on brawls, check the Brawl listing in the Player’s Guide.</p>

<span class="inline-block separator"  ></span><p><em>Consisting of a group of specialist spellcasters, the Dungeoneering Society is what makes Covalon thrive. The Dungeoneering Society is staffed by Portal Specialists that open portals and sustain them for adventurers to go through and return with vital supplies.</em></p>
</div><h3 id="portal-specialists">Portal Specialists</h3>
<p>Before you can run adventures, you must first have a Portal Specialists approved via a ticket. Portal specialists are the workers of the dungeoneering society that work tirelessly identifying, testing and using portal keys to send players on adventures. Specialists open portals during portal key testing and briefly scout the surrounding area to get a sense of how valuable the area is… and how dangerous.</p>
<h3 id="portal-keys">Portal Keys</h3>
<p>Portals are opened by using “portal keys,” which can be any small object, but most tend to be objects with a strong connection to a physical place in the world. Good candidates have strong, but narrow, “object memory.” Objects with broad “object memory” might open a portal anywhere in the world (such as a gold piece that has been traded through dozens of trade ports). But the location that a portal opens to is also affected by two other major factors: strong emotions and ley lines.</p>
<div class="block note red"  ><h4 id="living-portal-keys">Living portal keys</h4>
<p>It is possible to use a living creature as a portal key. This was only ever done once in Covalon, using a captured goblin raider as a portal key to attempt to find the location of the goblin raiding camp that was causing the city trouble. The goblin didn’t appear to suffer any ill effects as a result of being a focus for the key, but our specialists theorise that the practice could permanently shatter the mind of the creature serving as a key. Thus, using a living creature as a portal key is a felony in Covalon, and you cannot have your Portal Guide do this.</p>
</div><h3 id="dungeoneering-contracts">Dungeoneering Contracts</h3>
<p>All new characters to the dungeoneering society must sign a dungeoneering contract before they can complete any adventures on behalf of Covalon. This is a great opportunity to have people introduce their character to a group, and a copy of the contract can be found in the Covalon Module.</p>
<h3 id="emotional-resonance">Emotional Resonance</h3>
<p>Areas where strong emotions were released tend to magnetize portals to those areas. For example, say a village burned to the ground during the cataclysm and all the villagers were incinerated in a matter of minutes. The screams of terror and pain from the villagers would create a strong emotional magnet that might influence a portal key more than anything else in its object memory (hence why many portals tend to open to ruins or other sites of tragedy). The other major factor that influences portals are ley lines, which are invisible loci of magical power scattered across the world. Ley line interference is highly unpredictable, and can cause portals to open quite a distance off from the source of the object memory feeding the portal. As a result, it is impossible to “pinpoint” a specific location with portals.</p>
<h3 id="holding-portals-open">Holding Portals Open</h3>
<p>Once a portal is opened, it must be receive a constant flow of magical energy in order to remain stable. Portal specialists are capable of keeping portals open, though keeping one open for too long can cause quite a bit of strain on the spellcaster. For this reason, excursions should be kept to no more than a few hours in length.</p>
<div class="block note"  ><p>This is also a great, in-universe way to keep the party moving inside an adventure and prevent excessive stalling or delaying tactics.</p>
</div><h3 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h3>
<p>After a portal key has been used and a dungeon has been finished, portal specialists are instructed to destroy the portal key. This ensures that a portal key is not accidentally used again (as a to somewhere that’s already been cleaned out would be a waste of time) and keeps powerful entities from tracking Covalonians when they return home. As long as the portal specialist doesn’t come into contact with any creatures while scouting, the portal key is not destroyed during testing.</p>

<span class="inline-block separator"  ></span></div><h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of Covalon’s adventures is to explore the world, gather valuable supplies, fight dangerous threats and improve the post-apocalyptic world of Elleaterra. Try to keep this in mind when themeing your adventure hooks and narrative.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>The location of your adventure is one of the most important considerations after your encounter design and loot. The setting of Covalon allows for a wide variety of locations for your adventure to be set, but there are still some constraints in place to keep the feel of a post-Cataclysm world.</p>
<h4 id="a-post-cataclysm-world-in-recovery">A Post-Cataclysm World in Recovery</h4>
<p>The Cataclysm wiped out all known civilisations, with only scattered individual survivors. Covalon is the largest settlement that presently exists, but other survivors are beginning to recover. You adventure can include individuals or groups of NPCs surviving together in up to numbers of a small village (no more than 100 individuals). It is important to remember that there are no cities remaining, and Covalon is the largest remaining civilization. Any survivors out there should still be struggling with the post-apocalyptic conditions.</p>
<h4 id="living-in-a-material-world">Living in a Material World</h4>
<p>All adventures must take place on the material plane. Covalon is not a multi-planar campaign, although localised planar influences may be permitted if the narrative remains cohesive with the wider setting. Make sure to include any details in your ticket!</p>
<div class='columnSplit'>  </div><h3 id="npcs">NPCs</h3>
<p>Including NPCs in your adventure can allow for the inclusion of social encounters or just prime opportunities for roleplay. These NPCs must be included in your approval ticket if they are present. The world of Elleaterra is beginning to heal, but the setting is still post-apocalyptic. No surviving communities of NPCs should be larger than a small village (100 individuals), and they should be struggling to survive.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>NPCs can never return to Covalon. Magical defenses physically prevent any outside creature from crossing through the Dungeoneering Society’s portals. Players can give out directions to get to Covalon or our expedition outposts if they wish, but keep in mind NPCs are never roleplayed out of sessions, so they won’t have a chance to see that NPC again. An alternative to this situation is making sure the NPCs have their own motivations or reasons to not want to come to Covalon.</p>
<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>The level of technology for the setting can be summarised as ‘Gunpowder and Clockwork’. Stasian technology is too advanced, and even the most advanced pre-Cataclysm civilisations were only in the very early stages of industrialisation.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>This means that settings that include heavy sci-fi elements, factories, heavy industralisation or similarly non-clockwork mechanical elements are not appropriate for Covalon adventures. Mixtures of magic and machine are suitable, however. If you’re unsure if your setting.</p>
<div class="block wide"  ><div class="block note"  ><h5 class=" "  style="text-align:center;" id="shopkeepers-and-merchants">SHOPKEEPERS AND MERCHANTS</h5>
<p>You may choose to include NPCs that sell items in your adventures. You may also submit a recurring merchant NPC that shows up in multiple adventures (IE Phyllis the contract devil merchant, or Frisk the celestial trader). These NPCs may only sell consumables, and they should be sold at a 5-15% markup from their listed price. They may not sell disallowed items from the allowlist. Items sold by shopkeepers do not reduce the treasure budget of the adventure they are included in, as their items cost gold. Details about NPCs selling items and the items they have for sale must be approved in your adventure submission ticket.</p>

<span class="inline-block separator"  ></span></div><h2 id="gathering-players">Gathering Players</h2>
<h3 id="lfgm">LFGM</h3>
<p>The LFGM channel is the easiest way to get a ready made batch of players. LFGM posts are organized into individual threads, and you can be pinged by groups that are ready for a dungeon guide by selecting the LFGM tag in #role-selection. You can browse through the LFGM threads to find a group whose APL matches your dungeon and whose schedule matches your own, and notify them in the thread that you will run their adventure, at which point they will mark it closed.</p>
<h3 id="scheduled-events">Scheduled Events</h3>
<p>If you do not find a group in LFGM, or would rather not use LFGM, you may instead simply post your adventure directly to #📅scheduled-events. When you do so, you should indicate to players that they should get in touch with you via PM to send you their character details, including their token art and JSON, or other relevant means to import their character sheet to your table. You do not have to take players first-come, first-serve. You can add them to a pool instead, and select the players you think are most appropriate for your dungeon.</p>
<h3 id="mentors">Mentors</h3>
<p>If you are struggling to fill out the players required for a lower level game, the mentor system allows higher level players to join lower tier games by utilising pre-made NPC characters. Mentors should be used when you are unable to get enough lower tier players for your adventure, and can be used in any tier that patrols are permitted. You will need to install the Covalon Mentor Module in order to use Mentors in your game.</p>
<h3 id="making-adjustments">Making Adjustments</h3>
<p>Sometimes you will need to make adjustments to your dungeon after it has been submitted and approved. This might be because a player has dropped out, or enough players have levelled up that your APL has changed. When making adjustments to your dungeon, these must also be approved. Please Create a Ticket and submit your adjusted dungeon for approval with enough time to allow it to be processed.</p>
<h3 id="post-your-adventure">Post your Adventure</h3>
<p>Once you have decided how you want to gather players, post your adventure in #📅scheduled-events. Your post should include the tier of adventure, what type of adventure it is, the date and time you intend to run the adventure, and the adventure hook. If the group was formed via LFGM, you should put player names and levels here as well in a numbered list; Otherwise, fill the list out with applicants that get in contact with you, or add the players who apply to a pool and select them later.</p>
<div class="block note"  ><h5 id="waitlist">Waitlist</h5>
<p>LFGM games may have a waitlist in them, or you may get more applicants than you have slots in your game. When this happens, the extra players go on a waitlist. This waitlist is used if the primary selected players cannot make it for any reason, and waitlisters are used to fill gaps.</p>
</div><h2 id="during-the-session">During the Session</h2>
<p>You have spent time finely tuning your encounters, scouring over loot, gathered your players and its finally time for your session! Here are some key tips to help make your session a successful and safe environment for both you and your players.</p>
<h3 id="setting-ground-rules">Setting Ground Rules</h3>
<p>It is recommended that at the beginning of your session you set some ground rules for how you like to run your table in terms of player participation. Playing over Discord can be much harder than playing over a tabletop, especially when playing games with people you don’t know well yet. You should determine a set of boundaries and expectations for players at the start of your session. This can include things such as trying not to talk over each other, how you will settle rules disputes, when players should (and should not!) offer feedback and any other areas you think are important for your players to be aware of so they have a fun time at the table.</p>

			<div class="columnWrapper"><h3 id="managing-disruptions">Managing Disruptions</h3>
<p>We are fortunate that Covalon is generally a positive and welcoming space for everyone. We invite others to sit in and watch sessions being run on the server to help people get a sense for the culture of the server. As Covalon is a public server however, this means anyone can join and enter the voice channels while you are running a game session.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>The expectation is that anyone not actively participating in your game session mutes themselves and watches silently, utilising text chat channels for interaction relating to the game and freeing up the voice channel for players and yourself.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>In the event that a player or audience member is actively disruptive and detrimental to the play experience of your session, all Dungeon Guides are able to mute people in voice channels. If you do this, please create a ticket after your game to let the moderator team know so it can be addressed. In the unlikely event of ongoing or serious disruption to your table, please ping the moderators or admins for additional assistance!</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><h3 id="adjudicating-rules">Adjudicating Rules</h3>
<p>Pathfinder Second Edition is a complex game with a lot of rules, and we try to stick to RAW interpretations as much as possible. Sometimes however, there are some rules that you will need to make a decision on during a session, or you may have forgotten how a particular interaction works and it would be disruptive to the flow of the session to spend a significant amount of time looking it up.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>In such cases you should make a table ruling for that session, and endeavour to look up the correct rule after the session. You can do so in any of the appropriate text channels (🧮munchkins-and-mathfinder or 🐣newbie-help-and-discussion are a great place to start) or via creating a ticket to ask the staff team.</p>
<h3 id="death-and-downed-characters">Death and Downed Characters</h3>
<p>Pathfinder Second Edition is a tightly balanced system, and players will often find their character in the dying state in combat. For Covalon adventures, you are generally discouraged from attacking players with the dying condition, unless it makes clear tactical sense for the monster to do so.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>Actively trying to kill player characters is against the ethos of Covalon, but that doesn’t mean to say that character death will never happen.</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>The hallmark of a well-balanced encounter is one that is high in tension and the party barely makes it out alive. Sometimes though, characters don’t make it out due to bad luck with the dice, poor tactical decisions, or a combination of both. In the event that a player character does die, give the player the space to act out any final moments if they wish. After the session is concluded, please ping the @Servant Of Terra role. This guild handles the enacting of contracts and roleplay associated with character deaths.</p>
<div class="block note"  ><h5 id="areas-of-effect">Areas of Effect</h5>
<p>Sometimes dying player characters will find themselves in the area of a damaging effect that is focused on another party member. While it is discouraged to specifically avoid hitting an active combat participant in order to hit a dying player character, AoEs are dangerous and they will still sometimes hit a dying character!</p>
</div><h2 id="after-the-adventure">After the Adventure</h2>
<h3 id="loot-distribution">Loot Distribution</h3>
<p>Items must be distributed according to the following procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>1: At the conclusion of the adventure, all players go to the #🧮dice-channel and roll 1d100.</li>
<li>2: The GM notes each result, then posts the loot table in #💰loot-chat.</li>
<li>3: Players, in order of highest D100 roll to lowest, claim items by typing !claim [item name].</li>
</ul>
<p>Players can select a maximum of one permanent item.Any permanent items left over after all players have claimed an item are lost, but consumables may be claimed by player choice or distributed by the GM.</p>

			<div class="columnWrapper"><h3 id="lingering-affects">Lingering Affects</h3>
<p>Resolve and track any remaining lingering effects that have been applied to player characters throughout the dungeon. In most cases this will be making a post in 🤢 affliction-tracking and pinging the affected player.
At the end of an adventure, create a thread for each player who has received an untreated affliction from that adventure. Your thread title should follow the following format:</p>
<div class="block note"  ><p>Afflicted Player’s Name | Name of Affliction | YYYY/MM/DD</p>
</div><p>If the player has not identified their affliction, the name of the affliction can be “unknown disease,” “unknown curse,” or even just “unknown affliction.”</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>The first post of the thread should include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of affliction</li>
<li>Affliction stage (if applicable)</li>
<li>Effects of affliction at current stage</li>
<li>Affliction’s level (be sure to note whether this is a spell level or a non-spell level)</li>
<li>Save DC</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, you should only include information that the player’s character has uncovered about the affliction, but you can include more information if you wish. When the player makes a save against their affliction, be sure to reply with any information that has changed (normally the affliction stage and its current effects). If a player has their affliction successfully cured, the affliction expires, or the character dies, the GM should archive the thread. If the player character has an affliction that doesn’t show symptoms until a certain stage, you have two options: make the thread as normal, but don’t tag the player in it until they need to make their next save, OR make the thread and tag the player in it as normal, but let them know their character doesn’t know they have an affliction until after their next save.</p>
<div class="block note"  ><h5 id="lycanthropy">Lycanthropy</h5>
<p>Wereanimal curses can result in a player losing control of their character on the night of a full moon. In the event this takes place, you must create a ticket and add the afflicted player to the ticket. There you can talk with the staff team and player to come up with a fun, safe way for the curse to be resolved!</p>
</div><h3 id="dungeon-summary">Dungeon Summary</h3>
<p>A summary of your dungeon must be posted in the #📜dungeon-summary channel, with the following format:</p>
<div class="block note red"  ><p>Dungeon Name</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>Month, Day, Year | Average Party Level</p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p><em>Party Member 1 (Class and Level), Party Member 2 (Class and Level), Party Member 3 (Class and Level), Party Member 4 (Class and Level), Party Member 5 (Class and Level), Party Member 6 (Class and Level)</em></p>
<div class='blank'>  </div><p>Write a brief summary here. It doesn’t have to be detailed, just a general overview of what happened is fine to help players kickstart conversations in RP. Maximum length should be a single post.</p>
</div><p>Dungeon summaries are mandatory, and are used to help track experience and level for players on the server. You must complete any outstanding dungeon summaries before submitting further adventures for approval.</p>
<h3 id="delete-your-post">Delete Your Post</h3>
<p>Once everything else is done, and you have done everything else you need to do, including writing your dungeon summary, the final step is removing your post in #📅scheduled-events. This keeps clutter down and avoids confusing players.</p>
